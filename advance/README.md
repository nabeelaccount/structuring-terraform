# Advance Terraform Infrastructure setup

What makes this setup different to the intermediate is the use of separate repositories. Each module is grouped in it's own respository.

There is no module folder as the modules will be handled in separate repositories.

## Modules

VPC module: structuring-terraform-aws-vpc
Subnet module: structuring-terraform-aws-subnet
